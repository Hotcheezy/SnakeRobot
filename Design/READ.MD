Here are the designs for the camera case and the master module case. These 
designs were made with Autodesk 123d Designs, so please download that to 
view or change the design files. I have also included the STL files if you 
want to directly print these out. Print these with the following settings 
if you are using Makerware, and it will be almost the same if your using ReplicatorG
